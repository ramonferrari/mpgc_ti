2;2;2;2;4;4;4;3;3;3;3;Holacracy has done some good but on the other hand we sugar-coat things and people are not really being held accountable for their work.;My experience at iQ has been great. I do the work that is required of me and more. I always held myself accountable for my actions thus great productivity to get the work done even if that means working tons of overtime. My Lead has been a major factor with my push. I think that there should be some sort of compensation for numerous overtime as my mentality is I get the work done regardless of pay compensation and if I do for long periods, there should be some reward. A company does not want to have their employee saying they will not work long hours to get what is required done and meet deadlines for reason of not getting rewarded. We tend to be blind by politics in the company thus overlooking issues some employees have.; ;5;4;3;3;3;3,6;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4,00;3;3;3;3,00;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;3;4;4;3;2;5;1;5;1;1

4;2;2;2;4;3;3,5;2;2;2;3;"Yes and no.  Some areas have improved greatly, others seem to use Holacracy as a get out of jail free card. ""It's not my accountability"" or ""that's not my job"" is heard a lot.";All comments, from every survey should be taken seriously.  It is illegal to have your employees work overtime with no compensation.  It is also unfair to pick and choose which teams receive overtime compensation.  Titles matter, seniority is considered here, stop saying it's not, there absolutely are favorites here and we all see it.  Remember the little people.  Politics are everywhere, even at iQ, saying they aren't and not addressing the problem doesn't make it go away.; ;2;5;4;4;4;3,8;2;3;2;2,33;2;3;2;2,33;3;2;2;2,33;4;4;3;3,67;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4;4;4;2;2;6;1;5;1;1

22;4;3;3,5;4;4;4;4;3;3,5;4;It has definitely improved many aspects of the way we operate, but there are still influences outside our control that are directly affecting our ability to deliver on our purpose. This may only affect my team specifically because we are governed by a contract that limits the number of resources the client will pay for and holacrtacy does not provide a way for us to self-manage external clients. We always have top follow what the contract says even if we disagree with it.;Still a great place to work, however the formality of Holacracy has had an impact on culture it seems. I appreciate the focus on better fiscal responsibility, but it was a bit discouraging to see a conversation in slack on the topic of training. A single developer from a given team was very interested in participating in a local development conference, but the lead was still evaluating whether that learning opportunity could be justified in terms of benefit to the team and cost/budget with the circle... Telling someone they can't pursue a learning opportunity because there isn't concrete evidence that it will directly benefit the team doesn't really feel like we're investing in our people... But maybe that's an unfair perspective; ;2;3;4;3;4;3,2;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;3;3,67;4;3;4;3,67;4;3;4;3,67;5;5;5;5,00;4;4;2;3;4;3;4;2;5;2;3;2;2
23;4;4;4;4;5;4,5;4;4;4;3;Still not sure, once everyone buys in and all circles and roles are treated the way they should be, then I feel it will help improve iQ but right now we dont have enough buy-in from all leads and some circles still do not have the ability to set their own priorities. Those circles are still being told from different executives what is most important.;Overall I think iQ is amazing, but we need the buy in and support from higher levels to make sure holacracy works. We have a really solid start but we need all circles to be on the same page before we will see the true benefits of it. Also I think we need to re-think the lead link role. I personally feel it should not be your decision makers or best tech lead. It needs to be a person that is able to lead the circle and make sure things are going smooth and on track. There are a lot of people in the role that are having trouble balancing the lead link roles with Project manager and tech lead roles. These people are getting over stressed and the Lead link role could be used by someone who will find the answers not the one that knows them. We lose too much time with good developers not actually developing because they are tied up in other non technical meetings or chats. Just my two cents.; ;4;5;4;4;4;4,2;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4,00;3;4;4;3,67;3;4;4;3,67;4;4;4;4,00;5;4;4;4;4;4;4;3;6;2;3;2;1

50;4;2;3;3;2;2,5;4;2;3;5;It amazes me that we were functioning at all, without it. Holacracy has enabled people who normally wouldn't have talked, to meet regularly and voice their own tensions. I don't think people feel as alone as they used to when they're frustrated or have an issue. Holacracy always seems to offer a way forward, providing the next logical step that generally focuses on the work and desired outcomes. It's also teaching us to tackle more immediate issues to chip away at the bigger problems. I do sometimes feel that Holacracy lacks a structure that lets you see the big organizational picture. Cross-circle communication suffers as a result.;"We're losing good people in an industry where a growing number of companies are allowing employees to work remotely.

Old habits die hard, we need to pay attention to the circles who are always trying to get others to do the heavy lifting of their grand ideas.;What a blessing, I am not so obtuse to think any company is perfect.  But having the ability to discover who I am and the ability to pursue my passions has made me a happier calmer person.  What I have found though is the more I help others, the happier I am.   I still have goals to work on but, know the company I work for will support those goals.   ; ;1;4;3;4;4;3,2;3;3;3;3,00;3;3;3;3,00;3;3;3;3,00;4;4;4;4,00;5;4;4;4,33;5;5;5;4;4;5;4;3;5;1;2;1;3

68;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;Even if some aspects of holocracy don't really make sense (or work 100%) for some of the things our circle does, it has definitely made people more aware and more conscious about what they do and how it impacts the goals on the company.

69;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;3;I did not work for iQmetrix without Holacracy, but I can say that I enjoy this system of management and collaboration far more than any other I have encountered. Even being in a simple volunteer board meeting makes me wish Holacracy was common practice for both inside and outside of the professional office setting.;The sense of support and trust I've felt from my peers since entering my work at iQmetrix is noticeable and appreciated.

77;2;1;1,5;4;3;3,5;2;3;2,5;3;Holacracy has improved iQmetrix in terms of it forcing everyone to be accountable for their esponsibilities, but I don't really buy into it anymore since there are clearly a good number of departments ignoring it. It's too hard following Holacracy and non-Holacracy processes at the same time to get work done.;Why does it seem like senior leadership has been deliberately segmented from the rest of the organization? And we continue to shed all kinds of employees. Are we actually having financial issues? Are we really acquiring someone since forever ago? Should we all be stressed about iQmetrix's slow decline?

81;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;3;I have not been here long enough to determine this. Holacracy does have some good values from what I have been a part of.;iQ is a great place to work. The people are great.

82;3;2;2,5;4;2;3;4;4;4;2;I think Holacracy has the power to address many of the issues faced at iQmetrix. However, in my personal experience those who completely disregard Holacracy do not seem to face any consequence at all. The non-adopters aren't actually collaborating, they are just using the holacracy language to impose their will on others.;Negative team environments at iQmetrix seem to survive much longer than I would expect at any other company. Many sub-optimal or nearly failing projects are not addressed and are allowed to continue nearly failing instead of just failing and trying again. As a consequence a lot of team members are disengaged with their product, team and stakeholders on everyday work.; ;2;4;4;5;4;3,8;3;1;1;1,67;3;3;2;2,67;1;2;1;1,33;5;4;5;4,67;4;3;4;3,67;5;5;4;2;5;5;1;2;6;2;4;2;5

Some people have taken holacracy to an extreme and provide no value and have become near useless by spending time redirecting people to others rather than simply helping out the person and keep things moving along.";iQmetrix does not stand out or apart from other companies. As it stands there is no significant reason for someone to choose iQmetrix over any other company. Particularly in Vancouver where iQmetrix has to compete against many other companies whose appearance on one's CV is far more valuable than having iQmetrix listed.

However as you grow in the company and take on more responsibilities the wages do not grow enough to match. I feel this lack of competitive compensation has resulted in many senior and more talented people leaving the company for greener pastures. I hope to have many more years in this company but as time goes on I worry if I may need to find somewhere else to work to have a comfortable living wage.; ;5;4;4;4;4;4,2;4;5;5;4,67;4;4;4;4,00;3;4;3;3,33;4;5;4;4,33;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4;4;4;5;2;5;2;3;2;2

We seem much less united by common goals and purposes.  We need more oversight because individual teams seem too busy to coordinate anything beyond their own strategies.;It feels to me like there are strong strategic directions we should be heading toward and improvements that should be done.  I know my own project should be managed better but there does not seem to be time to focus on that when there is always a fire or something more important to get done everywhere.  I know we don't always follow best practices and I wish we had time to.  Things that cause massive frustration and overhead are usually external to our team and usually involve trying to coax work out of another team or individual.  As we get larger we are less and less in control of everything within our projects and it would be very helpful to have someone above teams driving directives and setting priorities.; ;2;5;4;4;4;3,8;3;3;3;3,00;3;3;2;2,67;2;2;2;2,00;4;5;4;4,33;5;4;4;4,33;5;4;4;4;5;3;2;3;7;1;5;2;5

The implementation process has been bumpy, and I disagree with a lot of the choices that were made, but we've come out way ahead overall and I'm excited about the current trajectory.;"I love my job, I'm excited to come into work every day, and I feel like the work I'm doing matters.  Holacracy has amplified that feeling 10-fold, because it gives me the tools to pick the work I think is most valuable, and the permission to feel guilt-free about the work that is lower priority and not getting done and the safety to be transparent about it.  My biggest issue currently is that many Lead Links have only received 1 hour of training, however they are expected to be the ""face"" of holacracy to their circles, and many of them just want to get the work of their circle done, and aren't really interested in working on team development.  I wish that they knew that they had the option to hand off the role of working on the circle to somebody who might like it better, so that they could focus on the work of the circle instead."; ;4;5;5;4;5;4,6;4;5;5;4,67;5;5;5;5,00;5;5;5;5,00;4;5;5;4,67;5;5;5;5,00;5;5;5;5;5;5;1;2;5;2;4;2;2

118;2;3;2,5;5;5;5;3;1;2;3;I see some areas where we have improvement and some areas where it's been confusing and holacracy affected the speed we move forward at. I think once we are through the implementation phase it will be better, but I wouldn't say we have improved yet.;It's interesting... holocracy is forcing me to have to collaborate more as it specifies who should actually do something (and as such, that I should not be the one to do it), in the past, if there was an obstacle I would just do it myself, now that doesn't go over so well. I would find that I would end up with really engaged and talented individuals all with a passion for a project - because the roles just grew out of the need in a particular project, so it was self-organizing. Now if there is a project/initiative - you have to try to build the vision around the goal, because people are just contributing to the goal because it's part of their accountabilities, not because they care about the goal.  I'm finding I have to be more of a cheerleader and constantly pitch the vision to get people excited/driven/motivated to move forward - whereas before the teams I worked with would just want to get it done.  I feel like holacracy is making it so we don't rally around a goal or a common cause, but rather just pluck away at the things we are accountable for.  I miss working with teams that just showed up with a drive to get the thing done... it felt more exciting and meaningful. On the flip side, I find myself having to consciously make efforts to get people excited and to care about the work in a meaningful way - it's forcing me to practice my leadership skills in a covert way. Since I don't really see myself as being in a leadership role at iQmetrix, it's kind of interesting to practice the skills. Keeps me entertained anyways.; ;2;4;3;2;4;3;4;3;2;3,00;4;3;3;3,33;2;1;1;1,33;5;5;2;4,00;5;4;3;4,00;1;4;4;4;3;1;3;3;6;2;3;1;2

It seems to work OK though.;The company is amazing but sometimes I feel a lack of support in better understanding the boundaries between my work and others' work.; ;4;3;4;4;4;3,8;5;4;4;4,33;4;4;4;4,00;3;3;4;3,33;5;5;5;5,00;5;5;5;5,00;4;3;4;4;4;4;5;3;1;2;3;2;1
142;2;2;2;4;2;3;4;4;4;2;I disagree that -Holacracy- has improved our company. Instead, I think the adoption process simply brought to light structural issues and implicit responsibilities that people had. The kind of introspection we needed to do (and still need to do) is more to do with figuring out our departmental problems ourselves so we that we have the information to organize ourselves into Holacracy. Holacractic practices haven't really had an impact, in my opinion.;I love the people here, and I've really enjoyed working and learning with them. However, I'm worried about the long term-health of our product and iQmetrix as a company.; ;3;2;3;2;4;2,8;5;4;4;4,33;4;4;4;4,00;4;3;3;3,33;3;4;4;3,67;4;4;4;4,00;4;3;2;2;4;3;2;2;5;2;3;2;1
143;4;2;3;4;4;4;4;4;4;3;We traded in some of our morale for (potentially) improved efficiency.  The changeover was helpful as a reminder that I work for a large, profit-driven company.;Transparency is super important! If you have to make changes that you think people won't like, own up to it. If you only tout transparency when things are going well, you breed a culture of distrust.; ;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;3;3,67;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;3;3;4;4;4;2;5;2;4;2;2
144;5;5;5;5;4;4,5;4;5;4,5;3;;I love working here. I don't feel like I am compensated well enough though. I feel like no matter how hard I work or how much my influence/responsibilities increase over the years,  the highest raise I can expect is 4% which barely passes cost of living increases each year.; ;4;4;4;4;3;3,8;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4,00;3;3;3;3,00;4;4;4;4,00;5;5;4;4,67;5;5;4;4;4;4;3;4;7;2;3;1;2
145;2;2;2;4;2;3;2;2;2;3;I don't think my circle embraced holocracy as much as the rest of the company, so I don't see it playing a significant role. I also don't think we adhere to it properly, my account abilities have changed three times this year alone and rhis has never been reflected in Glassfrog. It's hard to take this seriously or see the benefit when my lead link does not follow the process.;Being heavily micro-managed has alienated me from feeling autonomy or ownership over my work. I still love working here and see great potential in the team, but without ability to make my own decisions and grow or fail by taking risks, I don't see a lot of sustainability here, which sucks because I think I do great work, always get positive feedback, and have really good ideas to contribute. I love the team and believe we still attract great talent. The issue is retaining that talent on this team.; ;2;3;3;3;4;3;2;2;2;2,00;3;4;4;3,67;3;3;3;3,00;4;4;3;3,67;5;5;4;4,67;4;4;2;4;4;2;3;2;4;1;1;1;2

150;2;2;2;5;4;4,5;3;4;3,5;4;I think Holocracy has brought a much needed push for clarity within iQ.

158;4;4;4;4;5;4,5;4;4;4;4;;The process requiring us to post all jobs internally (and not just move people into new roles) is prohibitive and makes us lose some of the benefit of Holacracy.

159;4;2;3;4;4;4;5;5;5;4;I remain skeptical because that's who I am (and I'd be a poor QA if I wasn't) but, I can see that over time Holacracy has started to help my circle function better by making both strong and weak players more visible.;I think within my circle things are finally starting to change for the better. Strong performers are getting more roles and accountabilities, weak performers are getting feedback that wasn't as forthcoming before. Additionally, the whole circle is getting more recognition for the late nights we regularly have to put in to support each release, hopefully that translates to more than just extra snacks and booze with the new initiatives that are coming.; ;4;5;3;4;4;4;5;5;4;4,67;5;5;5;5,00;4;4;4;4,00;4;4;4;4,00;5;5;4;4,67;5;4;4;3;5;4;4;2;5;2;3;2;2

[Even when they've done some very sketchy and questionable things], while those of us who just work with our heads down and don't 'drink the kool aid' are left in the dust. I see a lot of inappropriate conversations and actions, and even though they're reported they don't get disciplined due to their standing as a 'golden child/cool kid/whatever you'd like to call them'.

Also the idea of respecting everyone as the expert of their own role, giving autonomy to everyone is a positive step. Other stuff has been hindered, in my opinion, such as adding process steps that seem unnecessary but that you can't criticize. I've heard facilitators saying ""some processes are optional, but if you are not part of it, then maybe you don't want to be part of iQmetrix, since it chose that as the organizational structure."" which might seem like either a warning or emotional blackmail.";"Feedback is fundamental in any relationship. And iQmetrix seems to strive for it, but so far I've only received one suggestion of improvement and I doubt that there are not other areas where people perceive I could improve. Some of the people that has been let go claim that they never received feedback for them to improve, they just got the notice that they were not a good fit; which I believe is not what iQmetrix wants to aim for. Additionally, iQmetrix gives lead links the opportunity to decide on the compensation for the circle member but then it gets debated and tried to get reduced when it has been thought that the circle member should be compensated better than average. I think this discourages lead links to go through the effort and pushes them to evaluate everyone as average, lowering the morale of the person being evaluated."; ;4;4;5;1;5;3,8;4;4;2;3,33;3;3;3;3,00;2;2;2;2,00;4;4;3;3,67;5;5;5;5,00;5;4;4;4;5;3;3;2;4;2;5;2;1

Despite many surveys and feedback given, it appears that some of the main issue are dismissed or ignored.  We have always claimed to pride ourselves on our transparency, visibility, growth opportunities and support of employees, however this doesn't seem to be the focus.  Employees are constantly taken advantage of and expected to do more than is reasonable.  Decision making and the process leading to decisions is not visible to all.  There is not enough input or consideration for employees, especially considering we operate with employees shares.  There should be more accountability at all levels for the decisions made.  More transparency into why we make certain decisions, what initiatives we decide to address, how we hire etc..

The situation is unchanged today.;This is an expansion of the same comment I put in the Holacracy question: I am totally bought into the idea behind holacracy and I think it could do wonders for us, but I'm skeptical that our leadership group is fully on-board. 6 months ago I was running up against executive-level micromanagement of my accountabilities, people playing politics to set project priorities, what-by-whens based on unrealistic expectations, and structural changes that were forced on me by someone else's grand vision of an ideal org chart rather than as a resolution of specific tensions. The situation is mostly unchanged today. There is so much that I could be doing to work more productively, but I'm reluctant to take responsibility given the political danger that still exists. I would like to know what our CEO is doing to hold his executives accountable to following the vision of autonomy he has set out for us, and how those executives are in turn setting the same expectations with their senior leaders. I believe these are all good people doing the best they can, but it still remains that if we have leaders operating like traditional managers we need to either coach them out of these behaviours,  or assign different lead links who can follow the company vision. Basically, create a safe environment for us on the front lines to express our autonomy.; ;2;4;5;4;3;3,6;;;2;2,00;2;2;2;2,00;2;1;1;1,33;5;5;2;4,00;4;4;3;3,67;4;4;4;4;4;1;4;2;5;2;3;2;2

There are good opportunities for skill growth such as sessions run by HR. I would like to see more career-specific opportunities for training and development. Also, more regular, formalized feedback would be appreciated, not only the annual feedback. This would be helpful to better understand where your strengths and weaknesses lie to help understand how to improve your day-to-day work as well as continuing to progress your career based on those strengths.; ;2;3;4;4;4;3,4;3;2;2;2,33;4;4;4;4,00;3;3;3;3,00;2;2;3;2,33;4;4;3;3,67;4;3;4;4;4;4;4;1;3;1;4;1;5

We often hear developers say ""well let's deploy this and see if anyone complains, and then we'll fix those issues"", or we hear ""my product is perfect and has no issues or bugs, but someone else's is continually taking down other products or services"", or we hear ""why do I need to follow that process?  It doesn't make sense to me"" and people don't understand that the small part of the company that they work in actually impacts others... or they don't care.

Except now we spend more time arguing about how we shouldn't be doing things because they are contrary to our strategies. Strategies that are, to re-iterate, a joke.;I think iQmetrix is a good place to work. What I do not understand is why we're trying to pretend like there isn't a hierarchy here. People like having a boss. If they didn't, they'd start their own company. What people don't like is being told that they have autonomy and then being passive-aggressively told what to do.

Holacracy may define accountabilities and try to make work explicit but it doesn't alleviate the uphill battle of trying to move a decade deep mountain of lousy decisions in the interest of speed and it doesn't change the fact that everyone who works here is still human with all the additional complications that infers. I assume this feeling will pass if i keep throwing my body at said mountain - meaningful change takes a long time, but right now, i'm in a fragile place where i'm unhappy and feeling defeated and would easily leave to go somewhere less uphill if the opportunity came.; ;4;4;3;4;4;3,8;4;4;2;3,33;4;4;4;4,00;2;2;3;2,33;4;4;3;3,67;4;5;4;4,33;4;4;2;4;4;4;3;3;5;2;3;1;2

There is a massive gap between intermediate and senior (or, level 2 and 3 as they are now named). The current structure also discourages people from becoming senior technically.

245;3;3;3;3;3;3;2;2;2;2;Holocracy has failed at iQ.  Despite the best efforts of the people who are passionate about it and work very hard to try to advance it, there are just far too many people in key positions who refuse to give up the power and that they had before Holocracy.  These people abuse Holocracy's tools, which sabotages the holocracy implementation and just recreates the old rank and file system we had before.  I'm not sure we can recover from this without the willingness to get rid of the holacracy rules that block the ability of lead links to assign work without a bunch of process, overhead and approval - this is the exact opposite of empowering leadership. The initial mandate of holacracy where people were told to either get on board or be let go wasn't followed through with for long-term and high level employees because many of them actively sabotage the process.;"Working here has become very stressful and frustrating for a lot of people here.  The constant mixed messages of saying that our priorities are one thing, then constantly doing the opposite are robbing us of our ability to create great experiences.  Some examples: saying we're focused on the Wireless market while not narrowing our resource allocation to that and at the same time opening new opportunities like the business-pitch board that diverge us even further; saying that we want better and more stable core products but immediately going against that to actively make our products worse in order to meet short deadlines for short term revenue gains; saying we want to retain our culture while actively discouraging things we've had in our culture for a long time; saying we want to adopt Holacracy while allowing people to create broad abusive domains that remove empowerment and accountability from the very people that holacracy seeks to give it to; saying circles don't equal teams while actively forcing people-based structure onto inner circles; saying that Lead Links and circles have the ability to meet their purpose how they see fit while dictating and imposing massive amounts of structure and rules about what roles can be created and how.  Most of that frustration would go away if we actually do what our strategies say we should do, even if we don't agree with those strategies. But this culture we have of product managers and lead links of the big product circles setting the strategies, then actively going against them is hugely disappointing and allows those people setting the strategies to not own the accountability of their outcome."; ;4;3;4;3;3;3,4;4;3;3;3,33;3;4;2;3,00;2;3;4;3,00;4;5;4;4,33;5;4;5;4,67;4;5;2;5;2;1;2;3;6;2;3;2;1

When people are given positions that they lack skills for, it seems there is a lot of hurt caused by this. And for as much as holacracy was supposed to be the solution for internal politicking, this doesn't seem to have worked. There's as much politics within the company as ever. When implemented, holacracy needed to have 100% buy-in from EVERYONE and that has not happened. There are lead links that continue to do their own thing and there are teams that seem to make fun of it as much as follow the tenets. I have no faith in the executive committee for a while and recent changes have not helped. There is a group of staff, shrinking all the time, keeping this work place bareable - they are driving the successes and seem to be reaping little benefit from it.
